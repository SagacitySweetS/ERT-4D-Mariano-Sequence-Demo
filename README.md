# ERT-4D-Mariano-Sequence-Demo
Empathic Resonance Theory (ERT) Mariano Sequence Demo: Exact SymPy computations scaling neural gamma waves (40 Hz) to cosmic vibrational modes via the Mariano recurrence (M_1: 1 to M_20: 31,219) and 126B state amplification. Explore the harmonic bridge unifying biology and physics—fork, run the notebook, and test predictions like 105.9 Hz sync.
